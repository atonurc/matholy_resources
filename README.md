# Math Olympiad Resources

Math olympiad was one of the most significant part of my life. During my high school days, I was very passionate about learning some olympiad maths and problem solving. I won't say I was good at it (still I'm not), but the experiences were fun. Now I'm a trainer at Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad camps. The notes I make for taking classes at BdMO camps, they will be uploaded in this repository.
